TODO: Only match allowed POS tag sequences in a compound word. For example adjectives must be prepositioned
  and so on.
TODO: Annotate compound entries in Norsk Ordbank. This would yield better size disambiguation heuristics and

# The decompounder searches for fullform matches from the beginning of the string creates a tree
# of match combinations for each initial match. This is implemented in decompound() and decompund_inner().
#
# The resulting trees are flattened to lists of word forms that the compoun can be split into. This is
# implemented in flatten() and flatten_inner().
#
# Fullform matches can be filtered on length (very short words are probably not "proper" words) and POS tag
# (compounds are for example not productively formed from closed word classes in Norwegian). This is implemented
# in fullform_index_match().
#
# NOTE: Not optimized. Can probably be made a lot more efficient.
